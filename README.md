# Bike-Sharing Assignment

## Overview

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, either for a fee or for free. Many bike-sharing systems allow users to borrow a bike from a "dock" — usually computer-controlled — where the user enters payment information, and the system unlocks the bike. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

### Business Context

A US-based bike-sharing provider, **BoomBikes**, has recently suffered considerable dips in its revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. As the pandemic eventually comes to an end and the economy recovers, the company aims to implement a mindful business plan to accelerate revenue growth and improve its market position.

The company seeks to understand:
- Which variables are most significant in predicting bike demand.
- How well these variables explain the variation in bike demand.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze bike demand and identify the key features that influence it.
- Build a predictive model to forecast bike demand based on various factors, including weather, season, and year.
- Provide actionable recommendations for BoomBikes to optimize fleet management, marketing, and operations.

## Technologies Used

- **numpy** (version 1.20.3)
- **pandas** (version 1.3.4)
- **matplotlib** (version 3.4.3)
- **plotly** (version 5.6.0)
- **seaborn** (version 0.11.2)
- **statsmodels** (version 0.12.2)
- **sklearn** (version 0.24.2)
- **scipy** (version 1.7.1)

## Final Recommendations for the Company

Based on the analysis of the final model coefficients, here are the key recommendations to optimize BoomBikes' bike rental services:

### 1. Month-Specific Strategy:
- **High Demand Months**: September (690.78) and October (298.87) show a positive correlation with bike demand. The company should focus on **increasing fleet availability** and **marketing efforts** during these months to capture more customers.
- **Low Demand Months**: July (-409.34) indicates a decline in demand. The company could consider **reducing fleet size** or **introducing promotional offers** to boost demand during these months.

### 2. Seasonal Considerations:
- **Winter Season**: The positive coefficient for **season_Winter (600.36)** suggests that bike demand increases during winter months. The company should **prepare for higher demand** by ensuring bike availability and offering weather-resistant bikes and services.
- **Spring and Summer**: Spring (-621.73) and Summer show reduced demand. The company should **reassess strategies** during these seasons, perhaps by offering **discounted packages** or targeting demographics like tourists or fitness enthusiasts.

### 3. Weather Conditions:
- **Adverse Weather Impact**: **Light Snow & Rain (-2569.47)** and **Mist & Cloudy (-720.92)** weather conditions significantly reduce demand. The company should **monitor weather forecasts** and adapt its fleet size in real-time. Additionally, consider offering **electric bikes** during poor weather conditions to maintain demand levels.

### 4. Temperature Influence:
- **Positive Impact of Temperature**: The positive coefficient for **temperature (4137.21)** indicates that warmer temperatures are strongly correlated with increased bike demand. The company should **increase fleet availability** during hotter months and ensure bikes are well-maintained for high usage. Marketing efforts should be ramped up during these times to capture the increased demand for outdoor activities.
- **Heat-Driven Promotions**: During particularly hot weather or heatwaves, the company could offer **cooling amenities**, such as water bottles or portable fans, to enhance the customer experience. **Promotions** targeting customers seeking cooler, outdoor activities during high temperatures would also be effective.

### 5. Holiday Strategy:
- **Holiday Impact**: The negative coefficient for **holiday (-473.84)** indicates reduced bike demand during holidays. The company should consider **holiday promotions**, **themed events**, or **discounted rentals** to attract more customers during this period.

### 6. Yearly Trends:
- **Increasing Demand Over Time**: The positive coefficient for **year (2036.47)** indicates a clear upward trend in bike demand. The company should **expand the fleet**, **invest in infrastructure**, and **improve customer service** to accommodate the growing demand over the coming years.

### 7. Windspeed and Safety Measures:
- **Windspeed Impact**: Windspeed (-1310.88) negatively affects bike rentals, especially in windy conditions. The company should consider **offering wind-resistant bikes** and emphasize **safety measures** or provide alternative transport options in windy areas to ensure the safety of riders.

## Summary of Insights:
By leveraging these insights, BoomBikes can:
- **Optimize fleet management** based on weather, season, and month.
- **Tailor marketing strategies** to specific months (e.g., focusing on September and October for promotions).
- **Adjust operations** to accommodate seasonal and weather-based trends.
- **Address external factors** like wind, temperature, and weather to ensure customer safety and comfort, ultimately increasing rental rates and customer satisfaction.

This analysis will help the company make informed decisions to drive growth, reduce costs, and improve the overall bike rental experience for users.
